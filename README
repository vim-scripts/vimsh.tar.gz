A terminal/shell buffer script for python enabled [g]vim (+python).  Allows execution of shell commands in a vim buffer.
It does not use r! <cmd>.  

Some of it's features:

* It retains state because it's interactive.  Set an environment variable and it "stays" because the shell process is the same through the whole session.
* It can run interactive line based programs like ftp/telnet/python/ssh/etc including masked password input (pty supported platform only).
* Since it's a vim buffer you can go into normal mode and move around the buffer, yank, paste, use word completion, etc.
* Runs on Linux, OS X, Windows, and other UNIX platforms.  Primary development and testing is done on Linux.  Windows has limitations (no interactive programs or Ctrl-C) due to lack of pty support.
       
Requirements:
To use it you must have a python enabled [g]vim and run on a platform that supports pty (i.e. Linux, OS X),
or pipes (Windows). The pty version has much better formatted output than the pipes
version and supports running interactive programs.  Please read the README for other installation
and configuration details.  Tested on vim 6.0/7.x using Slackware, Ubuntu, and Gentoo Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, and Windows XP/Vista.  

I'd also like to hear from users running other operating systems, i.e. QNX/Solaris/other BSDs.

!!!!! WINDOWS USERS !!!!!, there is a zip file available at the below link. The version
kept here on vimonline is a tarred, gzipped file ( tar.gz ). If you are going to use
Winzip with the .tar.gz file be sure to turn off the "Tar file smart CR/LF handling". It doesn't work
well.

Please send me bug reports and suggestions if you use it.  I appreciate all the patches
I've been getting lately!

See "terminal buffer" for more information.  There is also a (old) screenshot
of it running on Slackware Linux and Vim 6.0.
