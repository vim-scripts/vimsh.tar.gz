* I can't use multiple threads ( vim just hangs ) so I need to find
  a way to continue to get output in the background for commands that
  take a while to post stuff to stdout.  This would also fix the clean
  up after ctrl-c.  This issue is the the single biggest limitation
  of this script.  Without multiple threads or some notification scheme
  constant output can't be read and also allow for keyboard input.
  See vimsh.vim for an explanation of what I've tried so far and hasn't
  worked.

* Get ctrl-c working on Windows, commands like 'findstr foo' hang.

* verify ctrl-d on solaris works

* Ctrl-D/EOF not working on BSD for /bin/sh, verify still working on Linux (bash).

* Fix handling of ctrl-d, needs to do a bdelete.  Put proper checking of
  exiting flag after sigchld to avoid exceptions.

* How to handle stderr inline with stdout? popen4?

* Handle ( syntax hi ) ansi escape sequences ( colored prompts, LS_COLORS ).

* How can I use regex to determine syntax but hide/remove
  the escape codes?  Can be folding done within 1 line?

* Add hooks for write/read so scripts can ride on top of this one.
  i.e. GDB run in terminal buffer, script hooks write read etc parses
  output, and uses glyph to highlight current line, for example.

* Support vim/python native to 'cygwin', cygwin seems to support select.

* Handle textwidth appropriately as well as multiple line commands.

* tab completion

* command history

* fix handling of prompt
