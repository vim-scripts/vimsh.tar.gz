    ChangeLog
    =========

    This file contains a listing of modifications to vimsh.
    Dates are included.  All changes by <bsturk@nh.ultranet.com> unless
    noted.

    12/05/01 - 0.2a
                      * Fixed tabwidth
                      * Fixed not on prompt message
                      * fixed handling of user input execution rm -i works
                      * shells now die via autocommand

    12/06/01 - 0.3a 
                      * Fixed the first line issue
                      * Fixed the printed 
s

    12/07/01 - 0.4a
                      * Implemented clear, exit, and can now alternate between
                      * using popen3( pipes ) or pty.  This allows platforms
                        that do not support pty to work.  Should work on Windows
                        flavors.

    12/07/01 - 0.5
                      * Implemented secure input of passwords,
                      * Exit cmd works as expected, for subprocesses it
                        exits to parent, initial shell exit will delete buffer,
                      * Keep <Delete> from overwriting prompt

    12/08/01 - 0.6
                      * Removed the <Delete><BS> hooks.  They just weren't
                        working as I thought they would.  Now just check
                        for cursor to not be in prompt.
                      * Figured out the ftp issue see "notes".
                      * Added a mapping & func to set timeouts. 
                      * Changed pty prompt to something useful,
                      * Fixed clear

    12/10/01 - 0.7    
                      * Made usage of tty, pty condtional on not being windows
                      * Removed popen buffer size
                      * Increased timeout if using popen3
                      * Fixed output for lines crossing consecutive reads for pty
                      * Added map for starting a new prompt at bottom of buffer

    12/11/01 - 0.8   
                      * Windows support, tested on NT4 w/ ActiveState Python 2.2
                        Should also work on 2K/XP. Caveat hacktor ;)
                        Non interactive programs only, dir, findstr, attrib etc
                        work fine, no ftp, telnet, etc yet. 
                      * Made clear check more explicit, cleartool triggered it
                      * Fixed the mysterious missing single char issue.

    12/13/01 - 0.9
                      * Set buftype=nofile <b.cerrina@wanadoo.fr>
                      * Option to use current buffer if non-modified
                      * Use vim variables for options so this file doesn't need
                        to be modified to allow customization.
                      * Handle cancelling of input dialogs
                      * Flag unsupported windows console commands
                        ( partial list see:unsupp_regex )

                      * NOTE-- All attempts I've made to get interactive programs to
                               work under Windows have failed.  Without pty/expect like
                               functionality under Windows, interactive programs cannot
                               work using this script.  More specifically, programs
                               that do buffered I/O or read/write directly to the
                               console.  I'll try any ideas submitted, but for now
                               I'm punting.

    12/20/01 - 0.10
                      * !! NOTE !!: new way to run is to "source" vimsh.vim
                      * /bin/sh is symlinked to csh on *bsd, added csh prompt.
                      * Fixed mappings, needed to be set after buffer created.
                      * Added check for buffer's existence before writing prompt
                        and jump to prompt if it already exists.
                      * Ctrl-c ( SIGINT ) for interrupting continuous cmds, prompts
                        if multiple processes besides shell running.
                      * Cleaned up exit handling
                      * Added function and mapping for refreshing/paging
                        output when timeout is too short.
                      * Added vim function to redraw periodically during long
                        operations or continuous operations ( ie ping <host> or 
                        find /  Added redraw func to vimsh.vim
                      * Created ChangeLog, TODO, and vimsh.vim.  vimsh.vim is
                        now the way that vimsh is started.  The vimsh.vim is
                        a place for me to put code that is unsupported when
                        running python scripts within vim.  Only limitation so
                        far has been to not be able to define a vim function
                        from within a python script.  This file will also allow
                        users to add it to their plugin directory ( although
                        it is highly unrecommended )

    03/08/02 - 0.11
                      * Added support for sending EOF. Default
                        mapping is Ctrl-D (C-d>.  Now you can run python
                        for example in a buffer and quit it by typing
                        Ctrl-D.
                      * Fixed snafu of line split in the middle of python
                        statement which kept script from loading.  WHOOPS.
                      * Made the signalling mechanism more generic so I can
                        add more handlers in the future.
